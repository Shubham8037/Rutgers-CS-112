<title>CS112 Spring 2017: Problem Set 10</title>
</head><body>

<h1>Problem Set 10 - Solution</h1>
<h2>Heap</h2>
</center>

<hr>
<ul>

<ol>
<li> Given the following sequence of integers:
<pre> 
    12, 19, 10, 4, 23, 7, 45, 8, 15
</pre>

  <ol>

    <li> Build a heap by inserting the above set, one integer at
a time,
in the given sequence. Show the heap after every insertion. How many
comparisons in all did it take to build the heap?
    </li>

    <li> Perform successive <em>delete</em>
operations on the heap constructed
in the previous step, until the heap is empty. Show the heap after
every
deletion. How many comparisons in all did it take to perform these
deletions?
    </li>

  </ol>
<p><b>SOLUTION</b>
  </p><ol>

<li>
The heaps built one at a time are shown in the following table.
The first column is the item that is inserted, the second column is
the heap after this item is inserted (indicated by its 
level order traversal), and the third column is the number of 
item-to-item comparisons made by the sift up process.
<pre>Insert       Heap after insertion     Number of comparisons
--------------------------------------------------------------------
12           12                          0
19           19 12                       1
10           19 12 10                    1
4            19 12 10 4                  1
23           23 19 10 4 12               2
7            23 19 10 4 12 7             1
45           45 19 23 4 12 7 10          2
8            45 19 23 8 12 7 10 4        2
15           45 19 23 15 12 7 10 4 8     2
</pre>

Total # of comparisons = 12
      <p></p>

    </li>

    <li>The left column shows the heap (level order traversal
representation)
      <b>after</b> deleting the top of the heap, and the
right column shows
the number of item-to-item comparisons made by the sift-down process.

19 15 10 4 12 7 8          4
15 12 10 4 8 7             4

</pre>

Total number of comparisons = 21
</li>
  </ol>
<hr>
<li>Suppose we have a (<b>max</b>) heap that stores integers. 
(By contrast, in a "min" heap the
key at any node is <em>less than or equal to</em> the key at its children,
so the <em>smallest</em> valued key is at the top of the heap.)
Then,
given an
integer <em>k</em>, we would like to print all the values
in this heap
that are <em> greater than k</em>. Implement the following
method to
do this.
<pre> 
    public void printGreater(int[] H, int n, int k) {
       /* your code here */
    }
</pre>
  <em>H</em> is the array storage for the max heap, and <em>n</em>
is the
number of entries in the heap.
  <p><em>Note: The challenge is to do this efficiently. Use
the heap order
to reduce the number of entries of the heap to be examined.</em></p>

  <p><b>SOLUTION</b>

</p><pre>   public void printGreater(int[] H, int n, int k) {
      recursivePrintGreater(H, n, k, 0);
   }

   private void recursivePrintGreater(int[] H, int n, int k, int  rootIndex) {  
      if (rootIndex &gt;= n) return; // out of bounds
      if (H[rootIndex] &lt;= k) return; // all values &lt;= k in this sub-heap
      System.out.println(H[rootIndex]); // print root value
      recursivePrintGreater(H, n, k, 2*rootIndex+1); // left sub-heap
      recursivePrintGreater(H, n, k, 2*rootIndex+2); // right sub-heap
   }
</pre>

  <hr>
</li><li>Consider
a max heap that only
supports the operations <b>insert</b>, <b>deleteMax</b>,
  <b>size</b>, and <b>isEmpty</b>. A client of
the heap wants to update the priority of an entry in the heap. Since
there is no search operation, the only way to accomplish the update is
this:
  <p></p>

  <ul>

    <li>Perform successive <b>deleteMax</b>
operations until the entry is extracted
    </li>

    <li>Update the entry's priority
    </li>

    <li><b>Insert</b> the entry, as well as all the
other deleted entries back into the heap
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>What would be the worst case running time (big <em>O</em>)
of this update process on a heap with <em>n</em> entries?
  </p>

  <p><b>SOLUTION</b> 
  </p><p>In the worst case, <em>n</em> deletes and <em>n</em>
inserts would need to be done.
The time for the deletes is as follows (approximated for big O):
  </p>

<pre>    log n + log (n-1) + log (n-2) + .... + 1 = log (n!) = O(n*log n)
</pre>
The total time for the inserts is also O(n*logn ) by a similar
argument. The update process
is therefore O(n*log n) 
  <p></p>

<hr>
</li><li><span class="star">*</span>&nbsp;Suppose you are given two heaps, stored in arrays.
Write a method to merge them into a single heap, and return this heap. The original
heaps are not modified:
<pre>      public static &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt; T[] merge(T[] heap1, T[] heap2) {
        // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
      }
</pre>

<b>SOLUTION</b>

<pre>      public static &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt; T[] merge(T[] heap1, T[] heap2) {
          T[] res = (T[])new Object[heap1.length + heap2.length];
          for (int i=0; i &lt; heap1.length; i++) {
              res[i] = heap1[i];
          }
          for (int i=0; i &lt; heap2.length; i++) {
              res[i+heap1.length] = heap2[i];
          }

          // in res, sift up starting with entries copied from the second heap 
          for (int s=heap1.length; s &lt; res.length; s++) {
              int k=s;
              // sift up res[k]
              while (k &gt; 0) {
                 int p = (k-1)/2;
                 if (res[k].compareTo(res[p]) &gt; 0) { // switch
                    T temp = res[k]; res[k] = res[p]; res[p] = temp;
                    k = p;
                 } else {
                    break; 
                 }
              }

          }

          return res;
       }
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
